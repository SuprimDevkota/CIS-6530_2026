This repository contains our group project as a part of Cyber Threat Intelligence and Adversarial Risk Analysis course - CIS*6530 (Master of Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence program), which focuses on understanding, analyzing and detecting APT activities using Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

## Introduction
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are highly sophisticated, often state-sponsored cyber adversaries that target critical infrastructures to achieve long-term strategic objectives. APTs operate stealthily over extended periods, using well planned tactics to remain undetected, making them a major concern in modern cybersecurity. 

Understanding and identifying APT behavior is a key responsibility of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) analysts. This requires in-depth knowledge of APT tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), as well as the ability to analyze malicious payloads and attribute them to known threat actors.

This project involves multiple stages:

**1. Gathering Information and TTP Documentation:**
Research and analyze specific APT groups. Study and collect information regarding their origins, motivations, targets and attack campaigns. Document the identified tactics, techniques and procedures used by APTs.

**2. Payload Collection:**
Collect samples of malicious payloads associated with the APT groups.

**3. Feature Extraction:**
Analyze payloads to identify relevant features and behaviors. 

**4. Preprocess Features:**
Prepare datasets for AI based analysis.

**5. AI Agent Development:**
Design and implement AI models for APT detection. Analyze the results and evaluate model performance in detecting malicious payload.
