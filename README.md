This repository contains our group project as a part of Cyber Threat Intelligence and Adversarial Risk Analysis course (Master of Cybersecurity and Threat Intelligence program), which focuses on understanding, analyzing and detecting API activities using Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

## Introduction
Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are highly sophisticated, often state-sponsored cyber adversaries that target critical infrastructures to achieve long-term strategic objectives. APTs operate stealthy over the extended periods, using well planned tactics to remain undetected, making them a major concern in modern cybersecurity. 

Understanding and identifying APT behavior is a key responsibility of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) analysts. This requires in-depth knowledge of API tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs), as well as the ability to analyze malicious payloads and attribute them to known threat actors.

This project involves multiple stages:
**1. Gathering Information:**
Research and analyze specific API groups. Study and collect their origins, motivations, targets and attack campaigns

**2. Payload Collection:**
Collect samples of malicious payloads associated with the API groups.

**3. TTP Documentation:**
Document the identified tactics, techniques and procedures used by APTs.

**4. Feature Extraction:**
Analyze payloads to identify relevant features and behaviors. Prepare datasets for AI based analysis.

**5. AI Agent Development:**
Design and implement AI models for API detection. Analyze the results and evaluate model performance in detecting malicious payload.
